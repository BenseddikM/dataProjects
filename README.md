## Synopsis

Hello Dear visitor, this repository contains all my Python scripts that I did for random personal Data projects. You are free to contact me at my e-mail or my Linkedin if you are interested by my projects or my profile.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

This repository and all the project, it holds allow me to practice fully the Data crawling, the use of web APIs and some other coding stuff! I want to master python and its standard packages (specially pandas), to crawl and clean Data and do some Dataviz on the end to tell the story behind the Data.

## Installation
The majority of scripts are in Python and use the standard packages for Data analysis and Data Visualization.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

I am the only contributor for this Repository, but if you want to help me or continue on one of my projects, again please feel free to contact me :) .
